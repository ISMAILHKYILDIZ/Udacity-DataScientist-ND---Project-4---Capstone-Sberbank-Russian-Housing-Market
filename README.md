# Udacity-DataScientist-ND---Project-4---Capstone-Sberbank-Russian-Housing-Market

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- nltk 3.3.0
- numpy 1.15.2
- pandas 0.23.4
- scikit-learn 0.20.0
- sqlalchemy 1.2.12

## Motivation
In this project, It will provide disaster responses to analyze data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.


## Project Content
- Data
  - process_data.py: reads in the data, cleans and stores it in a SQL database. Basic usage is python process_data.py MESSAGES_DATA CATEGORIES_DATA NAME_FOR_DATABASE
  - disaster_categories.csv and disaster_messages.csv (dataset)
  - DisasterResponse.db: created database from transformed and cleaned data.
- Models
  - train_classifier.py: includes the code necessary to load data, transform it using natural language processing, run a machine learning model using GridSearchCV and train it. Basic usage is python train_classifier.py DATABASE_DIRECTORY SAVENAME_FOR_MODEL
- App
  - run.py: Flask app and the user interface used to predict results and display them.
  - templates: folder containing the html templates

## Example:
> python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db

> python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl

> python run.py

## Acknowledgements
I wish to thank Figure Eight for dataset, and thank Udacity for advice and review.
